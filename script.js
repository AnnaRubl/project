"use strict"
/* Assignment for the lesson:

1) Automate questions to the user about movies using a loop

2) Make it so that the user cannot leave an answer as an empty string,
cancel the answer or enter a movie title longer than 50 characters. If this happens,
return the user to the questions again. (You can refer to any string as
str.length - and get its length)

3) Using conditions, check personalMovieDB.count, and if it is less than 10 - display the message
"Very few movies watched", if from 10 to 30 - "You are a classic lover", and if more -
"You are a movie lover". And if none of the options are suitable - "An error occurred"

4) Practice and rewrite the loop in two more ways*/
